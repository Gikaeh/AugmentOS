# Contributing to AugmentOS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AugmentOS! This guide will help you understand the project architecture, development workflow, and how to make effective contributions.

## Project Overview

AugmentOS is an open-source operating system, app store, and development framework for smart glasses. The system follows a distributed architecture where most processing happens in the cloud, with the glasses primarily acting as input/output devices.

### System Components

1. **AugmentOS Manager** (`augmentos_manager/`): 
   - React Native application for smartphones
   - User interface for managing glasses, apps, and settings
   - Interfaces with native modules on iOS/Android

2. **AugmentOS Core** (`augmentos_core/`):
   - Android native module
   - Handles Bluetooth communication with glasses
   - Manages glass connections and capabilities

3. **iOS Native Module** (`augmentos_manager/ios`):
   - iOS native module
   - Handles Bluetooth communication with glasses
   - Manages glass connections and capabilities

4. **ASG Client** (`augmentos_asg_client/`):
   - Android app for Android-based smart glasses
   - Enables glasses to connect to the AugmentOS ecosystem
   - Provides a BLE API for android-based glasses to connect to AugmentOS Manager
   - Communicates with AugmentOS Cloud directly for streaming photos/videos

5. **AugmentOS Cloud** (`augmentos_cloud/`):
   - Node.js backend services
   - Manages app sessions, transcription, and display
   - Handles real-time communication between glasses and TPAs
   - Controls app lifecycle and display rendering

6. **AugmentOS Store** (`augmentos_cloud/store/`):
   - Web application for users to discover and install apps
   - Showcases available third-party applications
   - Provides app ratings, descriptions, and screenshots
   - Handles app installation

7. **AugmentOS Developer Console** (`augmentos_cloud/developer-portal/`):
   - Web application for developers to register and manage apps
   - Provides tools for app submission and updates
   - Includes documentation and SDK resources

8. **Third-Party Apps**:
   - External web servers that connect to AugmentOS cloud
   - Use webhooks and websockets for real-time communication
   - Leverage AugmentOS SDK for display and input handling

## Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SG as Smart Glasses
    participant Phone as Phone App
    participant Cloud as AugmentOS Cloud
    participant TPA as Third-Party App
    
    SG->>Phone: Input (audio, sensors)
    Phone->>Cloud: Forward input data
    Cloud->>TPA: Send relevant events
    TPA->>Cloud: Request display update
    Cloud->>Phone: Forward display command
    Phone->>SG: Update display
```

## Third-Party App Architecture

Third-party apps in the AugmentOS ecosystem follow a specific pattern:

1. **Webhook Endpoint** - Entry point for starting an app session
2. **WebSocket Connection** - Real-time communication channel
3. **Event Subscriptions** - Listen for specific user events
4. **Display Requests** - Send content to be displayed on glasses

## Development Environment Setup
