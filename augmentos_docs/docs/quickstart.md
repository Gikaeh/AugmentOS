# Quickstart

AugmentOS is how you write powerful smart glasses apps. In this Quickstart, let's go from 0 to fully functioning app (that works on [these smart glasses](https://augmentos.org/glasses/)) in less than 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Bun
- Basic TypeScript knowledge

## Building Your First App

The quickest way to get started is using our example app. This guide assumes you have a pair of [compatible smart glasses](https://augmentos.org/glasses) connected to a phone running the [AugmentOS app](https://augmentos.org/install).

### Install AugmentOS on your phone

Download AugmentOS from [AugmentOS.org/install](https://AugmentOS.org/install)

### Set up ngrok

We are going to use ngrok to expose your local app to the internet.  This is useful for development, but when you're ready to go live, you'll want to deploy to a cloud service like [Railway](railway-deployment) or [an Ubuntu server](ubuntu-deployment).

1. [Install ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/)
2. Create an ngrok account
3. [Set up a static address/URL in the ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/)

* Make sure you run the `ngrok config add-authtoken <your_authtoken>` line.
* Make sure you select `Static Domain`, then generate a static domain.

### Register your app with AugmentOS

![AugmentOS Console](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36192c2b-e1ba-423b-90de-47ff8cd91318)

1. Navigate to [console.AugmentOS.org](https://console.AugmentOS.org/)
2. Click "Sign In" and log in with the same account you're using for AugmentOS
3. Click "Create App"
4. Set a unique package name like `com.yourName.yourAppName`
5. For "Public URL", enter your ngrok static URL
6. In the edit app screen, add the microphone permission

> **Note**: If your app needs access to device data like microphone, location, or notifications, you can configure permissions in the developer console. See the [Permissions](permissions) guide for details.

### Get your app running

1. [Install bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
2. Create a new repo from the template using the `Use this template` dropdown in the upper right of [the example app repository](https://github.com/AugmentOS-Community/AugmentOS-Cloud-Example-App) or the following command:
   ```bash
   gh repo create --template AugmentOS-Community/AugmentOS-Cloud-Example-App
   ```

   ![Create repo from template](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c10e14e8-2dc5-4dfa-adac-dd334c1b73a5)

   **Note:** If you want a more in-depth example (recommended for those who've already completed this quickstart), you can use the [Extended Example](https://github.com/AugmentOS-Community/AugmentOS-Extended-Example-App) which includes app settings support.
3. Clone your new repo locally:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```
4. Navigate to your repo directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd <your-repo-name>
   bun install
   ```
5. Set up your environment variables:
   * Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   * Edit the `.env` file with your app details:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     PACKAGE_NAME=com.yourName.yourAppName
     AUGMENTOS_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_console
     ```
   * Make sure the `PACKAGE_NAME` matches what you registered in the AugmentOS Console
   * Get your `API_KEY` from the AugmentOS Developer Console
6. Run your app:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
7. Expose your app to the internet with ngrok:
   ```bash
   ngrok http --url=<YOUR_NGROK_URL_HERE> 3000
   ```
   Note: `3000` is the port. It must match what is in the app config. If you changed it to `8080`, use `8080` for ngrok instead.

> **IMPORTANT:** After making changes to your app code or restarting your server, you must restart your app inside the AugmentOS phone app.
