# AugmentOS SDK Reference

Welcome to the reference for the AugmentOS SDK. This section provides detailed information about all classes, interfaces, types, and enums available in the `@augmentos/sdk` package.

## Overview

The AugmentOS SDK is organized into several main components:

- **Primary Classes**: Core classes like [`TpaServer`](/reference/tpa-server) and [`TpaSession`](/reference/tpa-session) that serve as the main entry points for app development
- **Manager Classes**: Component classes like [`EventManager`](/reference/managers/event-manager), [`LayoutManager`](/reference/managers/layout-manager), and [`SettingsManager`](/reference/managers/settings-manager) that handle specific functionalities
- **Authentication**: Features for user authentication like [`Webview Authentication`](/reference/webview-auth) for in-app webviews
- **Enums**: Enumeration types that define constants and options throughout the SDK
- **Interfaces**: Type definitions for configuration objects, events, layouts, settings, and messages
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and utility classes
